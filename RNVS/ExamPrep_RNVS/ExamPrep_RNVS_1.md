- Propagation Delay d:
    - Propagation Speed v:
        - Speed of light: v=c,
        - In copper/fiber: v ~$\frac{2}{3}c$

- Unicast (point-to-point): one sender, one receiver
- Multicast (point-to-multipoint): one sender, a group of receivers
- Broadcast (to everybody): message to all nodes in the network
- Anycast (to somebody): message to one receiver out of a group of potential targets
- Simplex: unidirectional connection
- Half-duplex: bidirectional connection but only simplex per time
- (full-)duplex: bidirectional at the same time
