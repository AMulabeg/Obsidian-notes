  Packages:
    Packages are used to store and send data from source to destination. This is usually communication between routers.
    They are broken in smaller pieces. Most packets are stored before being sent. The packet switcher must first receive the who packet before sending it further.

  Propagation Delay:
    The time needed to propagate from one router to another. How much does it take for the first package to arrive.
    
    d=distance/speed

  Transmition Delay:
    The delay is L/R (Length of the package/ Bitrate). This is the amount of time required to push all the packet's bits into the switch/destination.

    EOL-SOT = data size/data rate
    
  Processing Delay:
    The sender needs time to process all the incoming packets. This is integrated into transmition delay.

  Queueing Delay:
    The packetes form a queue. The delay represent the time the packets wait in the queue before being transmited between nodes.
