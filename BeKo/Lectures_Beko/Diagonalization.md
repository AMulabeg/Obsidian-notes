# Diagonalization
Diagonalization (in theory of computation) refers to any technique which proves some X is not an element of an enumerable set Yi by constructing X so that itâ€™s not equal to Yi for any integer i. We basically cross the possibilities off the list one at a time while defining X, or construct it in a way that eliminates any Yi as a possibility via contradiction.
