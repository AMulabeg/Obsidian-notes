- # What is ISDA:
    - The combination of Data Management, Data Analysis, and Computing
    - The Combination of all of these form the science
- We can break down structure into 3 layers:
    - External Layer in a ANSI-3 Plan Model
        - The Front end client connects to the External Model
    - Conceptional Layer
        - Which is comprised of a Data Base model and a Conceptional Layer
            -Physical Layer
        - Internal Model for the ANSI-3 Plan Model
- ## Basic Terminology:
- A #Database is a collection of data that describes a scenario
    - A #Database describes a Universe of Discourse ( #UoD)
    - Any changes done to the #UoD affects/changes the #Database
    - Every #Database has it's purpose i.e describing a user-group that can be useful for another user
    - Data system DBS = #Database managing system + #Database
    - #Information_Systems is a system that creates, manages and uses data
    - #Data_Analysis is the extraction of information from data using Mathematical methods
        This will be further explained in [[Lecture 2]]
