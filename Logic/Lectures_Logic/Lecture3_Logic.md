# Normalform and Substitution

## Central Idea of Logic

- Let $\phi,\psi \epsilon AL$ Formula:
    - Model: 
        - For a $\phi$ there is a fitting chriteria $\beta$ that fulfills $\phi$, or a modal from $\phi$, when $[[\phi]]^{\beta} = 1$. We write $\beta \models \phi$
    - Conclusion:
        - $\psi$ follows from  $\phi$, written as $\phi \models \psi$, for all fitting $\phi$ and $\psi$ for the occupancy $\beta$:
